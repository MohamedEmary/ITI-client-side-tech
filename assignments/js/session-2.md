# Assignment

1. Write a program to check if a given number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else.
2. Write a program that uses `confirm()` to ask the user: `Do you want to proceed?` If the user clicks OK, display `You chose to proceed` in an alert. If the user clicks Cancel, display `Action canceled.`
3. Modify this code to use a ternary operator instead of if-else:
   ```js
   var num = 10;
   if (num % 2 === 0) {
   	console.log("hi");
   } else {
   	console.log("hello");
   }
   ```
4. Ask the user to enter their age. You must validate the user input (positive numbers only). Show the status of the user knowing that:
   - Child is between 1-10
   - Teenager is between 11-18
   - Grown up is between 19-50
   - Old is greater than 50
     Keep asking the user to enter another age until they click cancel.
5. Ask the user to enter a string. Count the number of vowels in that string (`a`, `e`, `o`, `u`, `i`).
6. Write a JavaScript program to convert the 24-hour clock to 12-hour, adding AM or PM based on its value. Use `prompt()` to get the value from the user.
   Examples:
   `0 -> 12AM`
   `11 -> 11AM`
   `13 -> 1PM`

7. Write a JavaScript program to convert the first letter of a string to uppercase. Ask the user to enter the string and show the result.
8. Write a script where the user confirms their choice of color:
   - First, use `prompt()` to let the user type their favorite color.
   - Then, use `confirm()` to ask: "You chose [color]. Is that correct?"
   - If OK, display an alert: "Great choice!"
   - If Cancel, display: "Let's try again."
9. Write a while loop that keeps prompting the user for a password until they enter the correct one.
10. How do you compare two dates in JavaScript to see if one is earlier than the other?
11. Write a JavaScript program to calculate the number of days between two given dates.
12. Use a for loop to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.
13. How can you extract the substring `World` from the string `Hello World!`?
14. How can you round the number 5.678 to two decimal places?
15. Write a JavaScript program that returns `true` if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, otherwise `false`.
